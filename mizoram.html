    <p>The Cheraw dance, also known as the bamboo dance, is one of the most famous tribal dances in Mizoram. The dance is performed by both men and women and is a form of celebration during festivals. It involves intricate footwork, where the dancers step in and out of bamboo poles that are rhythmically clapped together.</p>

    <p><b>Key features of Cheraw Dance:</b></p>
    <p><b>Bamboo Dance:</b> The dance is performed with four bamboo poles on the ground, which are clapped together by two people while dancers step in between the poles.</p>
    <p><b>Footwork:</b> Dancers must be agile and coordinated, ensuring their feet don’t get caught in the moving bamboo poles.</p>
    <p><b>Community Event:</b> The dance is typically performed during festivals and other community events, showcasing the communal spirit of the Mizo people.</p>

     <p><b>History and Significance:</b>
        Cheraw is believed to have been performed by the Mizo tribe in the 1st century AD, even before their migration to present-day Mizoram. The dance is often performed during festivals and other special occasions. </p>
      <p><b>The Dance:</b>
        Men sit face-to-face, holding pairs of bamboo staves, and tap them open and close in rhythm. Female dancers in colorful costumes dance in and out between the beating bamboos, executing intricate steps.</p> 
      <p><b>Musical Accompaniment:</b>
        Gongs and drums are traditionally used to accompany the Cheraw dance, and today, modern music is also incorporated. 
      <p><b>Other Notable Dances of Mizoram:</b>
        Besides Cheraw, other traditional dances of Mizoram include Sarlamkai/Solakia, Chhieh Lam, and Par Lam. </p>
