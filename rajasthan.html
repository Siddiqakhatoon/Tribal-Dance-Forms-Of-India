    <h1>Tribal Dances of Rajasthan</h1>
    <p>Rajasthan, the land of kings, is not just about palaces and deserts—it’s also deeply rooted in tribal traditions. Tribal communities such as the Bhils, Garasias, and Kalbelias contribute significantly to Rajasthan’s rich cultural mosaic. Their dances are expressions of daily life, nature worship, and tribal identity. Whether performed during festivals or community rituals, these dances are rhythmic, symbolic, and full of color and vigor.</p>

    <h3>Ghoomar (Bhili Version)</h3>

    </div>
    <p>Ghoomar is widely popular in Rajasthan, but its tribal roots lie with the Bhil community. Initially performed to worship Goddess Saraswati, it became more mainstream later. This tribal version of Ghoomar is earthy, devotional, and focuses on grace and group unity.</p>
    <p><b>Movements:</b> Performed in a circular formation with swirling ghagras, rhythmic footwork, and hand claps.</p>
    <p><b>Occasion:</b> Typically performed during religious events, marriages, and harvest time.</p>
    <p><b>Music:</b> Accompanied by traditional folk songs, dhol, thali, and nagara beats.</p>
    <p><b>Symbolism:</b> Celebrates womanhood, nature, and fertility.</p>
    <p><b>Origin and History:</b>
        The Bhil tribe originally developed the Ghoomar dance, and it was later adopted by other Rajasthani communities. 
        It was initially performed to worship Goddess Sarasvati and is now a part of various celebrations, festivals, and even rites of passage for young girls. 
        The name "Ghoomar" comes from the word "ghoomna," meaning twirling or spinning.</p>
        <p><b>Performance and Attire:</b>
            <p><b>Women-Centric:</b>
            While some tribal versions may involve both men and women, the Ghoomar is primarily a dance performed by women. </p>
            <p><b>Ghagra:</b>
            The dancers typically wear flowing, brightly colored skirts called "ghagras".</p> 
            <p><b>Other Accessories:</b>
            They may also wear veils and jewelry, adding to the visual appeal of the dance. </p>

    <p>The Terah Taali dance is a vibrant folk dance from Rajasthan, India, known for its intricate movements and the use of cymbals. The name "Terah Taali" translates to "thirteen cymbals". It's performed by women from the Kamad tribe, who sit on the floor and attach cymbals (manjeeras) to different parts of their bodies. </p>
    <p><b>Performance Style:</b> The dancer strikes the manjiras rhythmically while seated, often balancing swords or pots to display control.</p>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b> Traditionally used to honor deities like Baba Ramdevji.</p>
    <p><b>Instruments:</b> Besides the manjiras, dholak and harmonium accompany the performance.</p>
    <p><b>Fascination:</b> It’s not only musical but also acrobatic and spiritual in essence.</p>
    <p><b>Performance:</b>
        The dance is performed by women who sit on the ground, with cymbals tied to various parts of their bodies. They then use a pair of cymbals in their hands to make a rhythmic beat, accompanied by chanting and the music from the Chautara. </p>
